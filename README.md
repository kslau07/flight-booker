## Description

We’ll be creating a one-way flight booker. You’ll get lots of practice populating and building dropdown menus, radio buttons, and nested submissions. Let the fun begin!

## My Goals

I will not use any Rails form helpers for project, as recommended by the lesson. I will be working with bare HTML tags and attributes in order to understand how Rails interacts with these HTML controls.  

I hope to gain a better understanding of nested forms, `accepts_nested_attributes_for`, and model associations.

## Thoughts After
